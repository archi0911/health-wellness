			<h3>Be Mindful- Take your time and notice what you eat</h3>
			<p>To be successful in life, you need to define your own success, set clear goals, develop a growth mindset 
				(believing you can improve), learn continuously, build strong relationships, practice self-discipline, 
				and stay resilient by viewing failures as learning opportunities, all while taking consistent action and 
				maintaining a positive, proactive approach.

			<br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
			standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make 
			a type specimen book. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
			passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its 
			layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
			'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
			with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is 
			therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.<br>
